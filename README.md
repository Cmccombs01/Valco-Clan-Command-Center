# 🛡️ VALCO Clan Command Center: Data Pipeline & Analytics
The VALCO Command Center is a high-level strategic tool built to optimize clan performance in World of Tanks. By automating data extraction from the Wargaming API, this dashboard provides real-time insights into player activity, combat effectiveness, and recruitment needs, ensuring the VALCO clan remains a dominant force on the battlefield.

## 🚀 Overview
This project automates the extraction of player statistics from the **Wargaming API**, processes the data in **Python**, and pushes it to a **Google Sheets** cloud database. The final results are visualized in a live, interactive **Tableau Dashboard**.

### 🛠️ The Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3
* **API:** Wargaming.net API (World of Tanks)
* **Cloud Database:** Google Sheets API
* **Infrastructure:** Google Cloud Platform (Service Accounts)
* **Visualization:** Tableau Public

## 📊 Features
* **Performance Matrix:** A scatter plot identifying clan "Carriers" vs. "Support" players based on Win Rate and Avg Damage.
* **Master Roster:** A searchable list of all 97 members with real-time stats.
* **Top 10 Heavy Hitters:** A dynamic bar chart showing the clan's top damage dealers.
* **Inactivity Radar:** Automatically flags players who haven't battled in over 14 days.



## 📊 Big Data & Community Intelligence Portfolio

I specialize in building full-stack data applications that transform complex datasets into interactive, community-driven tools. My projects bridge the gap between raw data, visual analytics, and user experience.

### 1. [Valco Clan Intelligence System](https://github.com/Cmccombs01/Valco-Clan-Command-Center) (Live API & Automation)
A fully automated Discord bot and analytics engine built for a competitive gaming clan.
* **Live API Integration:** Engineered a Python backend to fetch and process real-time player statistics via the Wargaming API.
* **Tableau Synchronization:** Replicated complex business intelligence logic (Performance Matrices, Inactivity Radars) from a live Tableau dashboard directly into Discord.
* **Cloud Automation:** Deployed a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically run Python scripts and update clan leaderboards daily at midnight UTC.
* **AI Tactical Advisor:** Built a context-injection engine that analyzes a database of high-tier vehicles to provide strategic "Unicum" gameplay advice on demand.

### 2. D&D Campaign Architect (Relational Data & Streamlit)
A comprehensive web platform built for tabletop roleplaying game management.
* **Interactive Frontend:** Designed a clean, responsive UI using Streamlit to visualize large datasets (spells, monsters, items).
* **Advanced Matchmaking logic:** Created a 'Matchmaker' system that filters a massive database of 7,900+ pre-made characters based on party composition needs.
* **AI Storytelling:** Integrated contextual AI generation that pulls specific threat levels, locations, and character classes from local data to write dynamic adventure hooks.

**💡 The Common Thread:** Whether it's managing a 50-player clan roster or a 300-monster database, my focus is always on **Actionable Intelligence**—turning spreadsheets of data into beautiful, automated tools that end-users can interact with effortlessly.
